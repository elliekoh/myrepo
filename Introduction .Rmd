I like elephants, coffee and *Barefoot Contessa*. 

**3 fun facts**

1. Apart from myself, elephants are the only mammals that can't jump. That's why we get along, elephants and I. Elephants are also remarkably sentient: they can laugh, cry and *hug* by wrapping their trunks together. 

2. I own an espresso pot, a french press, and a v60 (this is a funnel) and a jar of instant coffee. This means that I can make coffee *4* different ways. 

3. You know those 'if you could have dinner with someone who would it be?' questions? I would answer with *Ina Garten*. She worked in the White House, and then owned a gourmet food store, and now she runs her own celebrity cooking show. You gotta respect someone who's done so many things! (*And, as is quite clear, she can cook a mean meal.*)
